              U.S. Responds To Rising Sea Levels By Patting East Coast With
              Towels
            </h4>
          </div>

            <p>
              In an effort to combat the effects of climate change, federal
              authorities responded to rising sea levels by patting the East
              Coast with towels, sources confirmed Friday. “Now more than ever,
              it is important that we take action to protect our coastlines with
              ultra-absorbent linens,” said FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell,
              who confirmed that the agency had dispatched teams across the
              region to mitigate any potential damage by wadding up, rolling up,
              and spreading towels across its beaches. “We’re proud to unveil
              this as the greatest U.S. climate change initiative to date.
              Simply giving everything a good patting down will preserve and
              even create miles of coastlines that we didn’t previously have.

              Ecologists Discover 400 Species Of Charles Darwin Living In
              Galápagos Islands
            </h4>
          </div>
          <div class="article-text">
            <p>
              Describing an astounding variety of naturalists previously unknown
              to science, a team of ecologists from Stanford University
              announced Friday the discovery of more than 400 species of Charles
              Darwin living in the Galápagos Islands. The Darwins, which
              researchers said have evolved to fill a staggering array of
              ecological niches throughout the archipelago, appear to have
              developed dramatically varied biological structures through the
              process of speciation, exhibiting beard lengths, for example, that
              range from closely cropped in some species to past the knee in
              others. Members of the Stanford team said they could tell which
              island a Darwin was from simply by studying the shape and
              thickness of its mutton chops. “The diversity of Charles Darwin we
              see in the Galápagos is the result of each species having adapted
              to survive”
